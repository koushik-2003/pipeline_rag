echo "## Installation"
echo ""
echo "1. Clone the repository:"
echo "   \`git clone <your-repository-url>\`"
echo ""
echo "2. Navigate into the project directory:"
echo "   \`cd rag_pipeline\`"
echo ""
echo "3. Install the dependencies:"
echo "   \`pip install -r requirements.txt\`"
echo ""
echo "## Usage"
echo ""
echo "1. Run the main pipeline:"
echo "   \`python main.py\`"
echo ""
echo "2. The pipeline will scrape data, generate embeddings, store them in a vector database, and handle query processing."

echo "## File Descriptions"
echo ""
echo "- **main.py**: The main script to execute the RAG pipeline."
echo "- **scraper.py**: Contains functionality for scraping and crawling websites or documents."
echo "- **embeddings.py**: Handles text chunking and embedding generation for storage and retrieval."
echo "- **vector_store.py**: Manages vector database operations such as saving and retrieving embeddings."
echo "- **query_handler.py**: Handles querying the vector database and generating responses based on retrieved data."
echo "- **requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies required to run the pipeline."
echo "- **example_output.md**: Contains example outputs and expected results from running the pipeline."
