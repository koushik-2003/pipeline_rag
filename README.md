# RAG Pipeline

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It uses a combination of scraping, embeddings, and vector stores to handle document retrieval and response generation.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koushik-2003/pipeline_rag.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pipeline_rag
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the main pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The pipeline will scrape data, generate embeddings, store them in a vector database, and handle query processing.

## File Descriptions

- **main.py**: The main script to execute the RAG pipeline.
- **scraper.py**: Contains functionality for scraping and crawling websites or documents.
- **embeddings.py**: Handles text chunking and embedding generation for storage and retrieval.
- **vector_store.py**: Manages vector database operations such as saving and retrieving embeddings.
- **query_handler.py**: Handles querying the vector database and generating responses based on retrieved data.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies required to run the pipeline.
- **example_output.md**: Contains example outputs and expected results from running the pipeline.

## Example Output

Check `example_output.md` for sample outputs and responses generated by the pipeline.
